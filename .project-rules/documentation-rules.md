   - Key features and benefits
   - Status badges (Go version, license, etc.)

2. **Installation & Setup**
   - Prerequisites and dependencies
   - Build instructions from source
   - Installation options (binary, system install)

3. **Configuration Guide**
   - Home Assistant URL discovery
   - Long-lived token creation (step-by-step)
   - Configuration file format and locations
   - Environment variable options

4. **Usage Documentation**
   - Command reference with examples
   - Natural language syntax explanation
   - Common use cases and workflows
   - Global flags and options

5. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common connection issues
   - Authentication problems
   - Entity resolution problems
   - Platform-specific issues

6. **Development Information**
   - Project structure overview
   - Build and test instructions
   - Contribution guidelines

### Feature Implementation Updates

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Every time new functionality is implemented, the README.md MUST be updated to include:

- New command examples in the Usage section
- Updated feature list in the Overview
- Any new configuration options
- New troubleshooting scenarios
- Updated command reference table

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Examples
- All code examples must be tested and working
- Use realistic Home Assistant entity names
- Include expected output where helpful
- Show both success and error scenarios

#### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Write for beginners but include advanced tips
- Use active voice and imperative mood for instructions
- Include context for why features are useful

#### Formatting
- Use consistent markdown formatting
- Include proper heading hierarchy
- Use code blocks with language specification
- Include tables for reference information

## Code Documentation

### Package Documentation
Every package must have:
- Package-level comment explaining purpose
- Key type and interface documentation
- Example usage for public APIs

### Function Documentation
Public functions must include:
- Purpose and behavior description
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value explanations
- Example usage for complex functions

### Inline Comments
- Explain non-obvious logic
- Document performance considerations
- Explain security-related decisions
- Note future improvement opportunities

## Version Documentation

### Changelog Requirements
Maintain CHANGELOG.md with:
- Version numbers following semantic versioning
- New features and improvements
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes
- Migration guides for breaking changes

### Release Documentation
For each release:
- Update version information in README
- Document new features with examples
- Update compatibility information
- Include upgrade instructions

## User Experience Documentation

### Getting Started Flow
The documentation must provide a clear path from:
1. Project discovery → Installation
2. Installation → Configuration  
3. Configuration → First successful command
4. Basic usage → Advanced features

### Error Messages
- All error messages should reference documentation
- Include suggested solutions in error output
- Link to relevant troubleshooting sections

### Examples and Tutorials
- Provide real-world usage scenarios
- Include common automation patterns
- Show integration with other tools
- Demonstrate best practices

## Documentation Maintenance

### Update Triggers
README.md must be updated when:
- New commands are added
- Command syntax changes
- New configuration options are added
- Dependencies change
- Installation process changes
- New troubleshooting scenarios are discovered

### Review Requirements
- All documentation changes must be reviewed for accuracy
- Test all code examples before committing
- Verify links and references work correctly
- Check formatting renders correctly on GitHub

### Consistency Checks
- Ensure command examples match actual implementation
- Verify feature lists are complete and accurate
- Check that troubleshooting covers common issues
- Validate installation instructions on clean systems

## AI Development Integration

### Implementation Loop Requirements
When AI tools implement new features, they MUST:

1. **Analyze Impact**: Determine what documentation needs updating
2. **Update README**: Add new features, commands, examples
3. **Update Inline Docs**: Ensure code comments are current
4. **Test Examples**: Verify all documentation examples work
5. **Review Completeness**: Check no features are undocumented

### Documentation Quality Gates
Before considering implementation complete:
- [ ] All new commands documented with examples
- [ ] Updated feature list reflects current capabilities
- [ ] Configuration changes documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting updated for new scenarios
- [ ] Examples tested and working
- [ ] Command reference table updated

### Documentation Testing
- Build and test all installation instructions
- Verify all command examples execute successfully
- Check configuration examples parse correctly
- Validate troubleshooting steps resolve issues

## Metrics and Validation

### Documentation Coverage
Track that documentation covers:
- 100% of user-facing commands
- 100% of configuration options
- 90%+ of common error scenarios
- Key integration patterns

### User Feedback Integration
- Monitor issues for documentation gaps
- Update documentation based on user questions
- Improve clarity based on user feedback
- Add examples for commonly requested scenarios

### Automated Checks
- Lint markdown files for consistency
- Check internal links are valid
- Verify code block syntax highlighting
- Test example commands in CI/CD

This ensures the README.md stays current and comprehensive as the project evolves, providing users with the information they need to successfully use the Home Assistant CLI.
